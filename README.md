# Predicting-cancer-death-rate-
Predicting  the global cancer  death rate for the year
Context:
As per WHO,

Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, and is responsible for an estimated 10 million deaths in 2022. Globally, about 1 in 6 deaths is due to cancer.

Approximately 70% of deaths from cancer occur in low- and middle-income countries.

Around one third of deaths from cancer are due to the 5 leading behavioral and dietary risks: high body mass index, low fruit and vegetable intake, lack of physical activity, tobacco use, and alcohol use.
Problem Statement Many aspects of the behaviour of cancer disease are highly unpredictable. Even with the huge number of studies that have been done on the DNA mutation responsible for the disease, we are still unable to use these information at clinical level. However, it is important that we understand the effects and impacts of this disease from the past information as much as we possibly can.

Objective
build a machine learning model that would predict the cancer death rate for the given year.
